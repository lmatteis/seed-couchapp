# About This Site

By [scraping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) through a list of genebank websites we can automatically retrieve genebank data, without any manual intervention. 

Anything that is available through a website can be scraped. The goal is to scrape as much data as possible and have this website serve as a **central database** for genebank information.
